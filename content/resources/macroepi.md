  a form of cancer, vascular disease or diabetes of interest to him or her. Every
  three weeks a "chapter" is due in draft form with references developed in parallel
  with material from class that uses colon and lung cancer as principle examples.
  A "chapter" would be on the order of four-five pages of discussion of the key facts
  about the chosen disease.
